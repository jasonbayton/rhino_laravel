Bayton.org has been running here for almost 12 years, and I've been writing about Android for almost 5 of those.

It's been quite an adventure.

Throughout the website's history there have been a number of redesigns, with [bayton.org]() currently leveraging it's 4th major redesign, and what you're seeing here being a preview of the official v5 (still under development).

What hasn't happened in a long time however is a major shift of focus. Those who follow my ramblings on Twitter and LinkedIn may have come across the odd posts musing the pivot to ChromeOS, Jolla, Mobile linux, and other platforms over the years, but I've tended to always fall back to Android Enterprise.

Well, following the year which shall not be named, and the amount of time we've all collectively had locked at home to pick up new hobbies, I made the decision to put my Android Enterprise focus aside and start working on providing clear, easy to digest, in-depth documentation for a brand new platform.

Check out the [new homepage](/).

I've built a pretty nice niche for myself with Android, but I know organisations often leverage a mix of platforms to enable their workforce; I look forward to seeing many of you, existing and new readers, follow me on the next 5 years.
