![](http://static.dlvr.it/images/dlvrit_logo.png "dlvr.it logo")Although it's not technically possible from Google+ itself quite yet (that API is taking it's time..) outlined below is a quick and easy way of using dlvr.it and appspot to take your public Google+ posts and push them to your other social media accounts.

Note: This is an unofficial method and will undoubtedly become outdated at some point in the not too distant future.

This post is extremely similar to my previous [Pushing Buzz to Twitter with dlvr.it](/2011/05/pushing-buzz-to-twitter-with-dlvr-it/) so if you see similarities, you'll know why.

For this (and following) article, I will assume you are signed up and logged in. If you’re not, head over to [dlvr.it](http://dlvr.it/) now and get it done!

Logged in? Alright then, off we go.

The first thing you’ll need is your public Google+ Feed URL. There’s no need to go hunting around for it, as I’ve provided it here:

http://dlvritplus.appspot.com/PROFILEID

All you’ll need to change is PROFILEID. For you, this’ll be a number you see when you go to your Google+ profile, so for example mine is:

[http://dlvritplus.appspot.com/**107941235164261478540**](http://dlvritplus.appspot.com/107941235164261478540)

Simple, right? Now you have that, you can create your new Route. Whenever you’re ready, you can click that all important button!

As soon as you’ve hit the button, you’ll be greeted with a screen you’ll no doubt become familiar with as you turn into a dlvr.it power user.. ;)

Give your new route a name and hit “+ add” in Sources. This is where we’ll get your Google+ feed in and set to be pushed to Twitter/Facebook when we’re done. Be prepared, there are a lot of options you can potentially set here. I’ll show what’s required and trust you can take all the time you need to check out the other options at a later time.

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/screenshot.163.png "screenshot.163")](/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/screenshot.163.png)

**Feed URL** is where you’ll enter the Google+ feed I posted above, though with your profile number, obviously.. unless you want to post my updates? I’d be flattered, I’m sure! I doubt you’d be too happy though..

**When should we make your first post?** gives you the option to post your latest Google+, wait until your next Post, or to publish every Post you’ve posted. If your Twitter or Facebook account is a little slow, you may find publishing everything gives the illusion you’re (suddenly!) very active on twitter!

**Feed active** simply turns the source on or off. We’ll definitely want it on.

**Retrieve Log** may come in handy later, it shows when your source was last polled and what was delivered for you.

We’re now ready to save the source. With this information set, all of your Google+ posts will be pushed to Twitter or Facebook every 15 minutes. Wanting more control? Take a look at the menu items along the top:

**Feed update** allows you to set how often dlvr.it checks for new posts. It’s every 15minutes by default.

**Item text** allows you to define prefixes and suffixes to every post, and to find & replace any content you wish within each post.

**Filters** allow you to specify on what words will trigger dlvr.it to pick up a post. You could, for example, only push posts you specifically want on Twitter with a #twitter tag. Any post then posted with that tag will be posted to Twitter.

**Scheduling** allows you to define when **Feed update** will run.

**Location** allows you to define whether location in posts will be transferred to Twitter or Facebook.

And finally, there are some **Advanced options** that you may consider quickly perusing on the off-chance there’s an option there that suits your needs.

We’re definitely ready to hit save source now. Let’s move on.

Once you’ve saved the source, your route will become visible again. Simply click on “+ add” on Destination to add your Twitter or Facebook information.

On the next screen, you’ll be prompted to choose a destination. There are a number to choose from, but luckily someone has decided to place Twitter and Facebook at the top of the list (it’s like they _know_ what we’re doing).

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/screenshot.164.png "screenshot.164")](/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/screenshot.164.png)

Click new and wait for the next screen.

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/screenshot.166.png "screenshot.166")](/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/screenshot.166.png)

Almost there now – Make sure **Active** is ticked and click **Start Authorisation**. You’ll now be taken to Twitter or Facebook to sign in before returning to this screen after a confirmation message. Before you click save you can again set a couple of extra options, such as what parts of your Google+ post to post in **Post Content** and how dlvr.it will handle hashtags in **Advanced**.

Have you finished tinkering? As soon as you hit save you’ll be returned to your route list where you’ll see a new, shiny Google+ to Twitter route. The final step is to make sure **Active** is showing in the top right of the route, if it isn’t, click it.

And that, my good reader, is all there is to it. If you’re impatient you can hover over the Google+ source and click the little circle to the right of what I’ve called “Google+”. This will force a check for posts. Otherwise, carry on with your day. This is sorted.

If you have any questions at all, please let me know. If not, enjoy completely hassle-free Google+ to Twitter/Facebook deliveries!

Cheers, Jason
