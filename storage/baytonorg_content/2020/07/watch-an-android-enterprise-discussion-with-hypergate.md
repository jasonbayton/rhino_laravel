In planning since before MWC was [cancelled](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51474116), myself and Alessandro of [Hypergate](https://hypergate.com) finally got to sit down and chat a bit about Android, enterprise mobility and the current situation.

It was a pleasure to be Hypergate's first guest on their new Mobile Security Talk series. Until next time!
