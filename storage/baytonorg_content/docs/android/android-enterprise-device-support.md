<div class="callout callout-warning">
	<div class="callout-heading">No longer maintained</div>
	While I am still actively testing devices, I no longer publish them here. Consider the below to be historical, including the advanced testing, and not to be taken as current status of a device. If you'd like your devices tested against Android Enterprise functionality, feel free to get in touch.
</div>

The devices listed below have been tested against a current, Android Enterprise-compatible Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) platform for one or more of the following:

- Android Enterprise work profile
- Android Enterprise fully managed (work-managed)
- Android Enterprise work profile on a fully managed device (COPE/COMP)
- Android Enterprise dedicated (COSU or kiosk)
- Multiple provisioning methods, including [zero-touchÂ enrolment](/docs/enterprise-mobility/android/what-is-android-zero-touch-enrolment/)

<div class="callout callout-info">
	<div class="callout-heading">OEM or reseller?</div>
  <p>I welcome additional devices for testing! If you're an <b>OEM</b> or <b>reseller</b> of Android devices, you can join <b>Sony</b>, <b>Nokia</b>, <b>Huawei</b> and others in lending me anything from Android 6.0.1 or later to independently test. This is a free service, devices can be returned within a week or so. Use my <a href="/contact">contact</a> page to get in touch or <a href="mailto:jason@bayton.org">email me directly</a>.</p>

  <p>For more information on what's involved in testing, please head to: <a href="/docs/enterprise-mobility/android/android-enterprise-device-support/validation-process-and-information/">Android Enterprise independent validation process and information</a>.</p>

## [Advanced testing](#advanced-testing) {#advanced-testing}

The following devices have undergone advanced testing. Introduced in June 2019, advanced testing follows the same [process](/docs/enterprise-mobility/android/android-enterprise-device-support/validation-process-and-information/) as standard testing, but each individual restriction/function is documented and verified irrespective of outcome across at least two EMMs.

A report containing 700+ touch points is provided to the OEM on completion along with any recommendations.

- [Google Pixel 3a Android Enterprise validation report](/docs/enterprise-mobility/android/android-enterprise-device-support/google-pixel-3a-validation-report/)
- [Moto G7 Power Android Enterprise validation report](/docs/enterprise-mobility/android/android-enterprise-device-support/moto-g7-power-android-enterprise-validation-report/)
- [Sony Xperia L3 Android Enterprise validation report](/docs/enterprise-mobility/android/android-enterprise-device-support/sony-xperia-l3-android-enterprise-validation-report/)

## [Standard testing](#standard-testing) {#standard-testing}

The following devices have undergone standard testing. Standard testing involves the same [process](/docs/enterprise-mobility/android/android-enterprise-device-support/validation-process-and-information/) as advanced testing, but without in-depth documentation and additional verification across multiple EMMs.

For each of these use-cases, the device will be provided a pass (), a warning ( / ), a fail () or untested (), along with the party who verified the functionality (as some information may be externally sourced). The OS version (if) listed is valid at the time of testing. It's normally safe to assume newer OS versions will support _at a minimum_ the below tested functionality.

## Google

### Google Nexus 5x

Tested 2017

![](/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nexus-intro-phone-1-e1506902903947-246x500.png)

### Google Pixel 2

Tested 2018

![](/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pixel2.png)

##### Tech specs

Android 8.1.0  
5.0 inch FHD display

## Huawei

### Huawei MediaPad M5 (8.0)

Tested June 2018, build 8.0.0.151

![](/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/m5.png)

##### Tech specs

Android 8.0  
8.4 inch QHD display  
HiSilicon Kirin 960s  
4GB RAM  
32/64/128GB Storage  
13/8MP Cameras

Fully managed (COBO)  
Managed work profile (COPE)  
Dedicated (COSU)  
NFC provisioning  
AFW# provisioning  
QR provisioning  
Zero-touch enrolment

Notes: Due to the amount of T&C pages, zero-touch provisioning is anything but. Huawei include non-mandatory system applications (the Microsoft Suite) in the fully managed environment, which should not be done. **Builds prior to 8.0.0.151 had provisioning issues.**

### Huawei P10

Tested 2017

![](/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/p10-listimage-black.png)

##### Tech specs

Android 7.0  
5.1 inch FHD display  
HiSilicon Kirin 960  
4GB RAM  
32/64GB Storage  
20/12MP Cameras  
NFC support  
Fingerprint support

##### Android Enterprise support

Work profile (BYOD)  
Fully managed (COBO)  
Dedicated (COSU)  
NFC provisioning  
AFW# provisioning  
QR provisioning

Notes: NFC provisioning is interrupted by the First Run Wizard, prompting for a Google account, WiFi information and more, before eventually landing on the home screen. The DPC agent does not automatically launch, and DPC extras are not passed to the agent. It does then work as expected. DPCi enrolment fails with MobileIron, as the device is not recognised as a fully managed device by the DPC. QR provisioning is not supported.

## Motorola

### Motorola Moto Z

Tested 2017

![](/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Motorola-Moto-Z-Force-Gold-Front-e1506902735436-247x500.png)

##### Android Enterprise support

Work profile (BYOD)  
Fully managed (COBO)  
Dedicated (COSU)  
NFC provisioning  
AFW# provisioning

Notes: NFC provisioning is interrupted by the First Run Wizard, prompting for a Google account, WiFi information and more, before eventually landing on the home screen and launching the DPC directly after. NFC provisioning appears to be partially broken.

### Motorola Moto C Plus

Tested 2017

![](/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/motorola-moto-c-plus.png)

##### Tech specs

Android 7.0  
5.0 inch HD display  
Mediatek MT6737  
1GB RAM  
16GB Storage  
8/2MP Cameras  
NFC support  
Fingerprint support

##### Android Enterprise support

Work profile (BYOD)  
Fully managed (COBO)  
Dedicated (COSU)  
NFC provisioning  
AFW# provisioning

Notes: As part of enrolment, the device is prompted to encrypt. From Nougat (7.0) encryption should be default and this is therefore unexpected. Encryption may take some time. Interruptions from the Wizard during both QR and DPCi enrolment. DCP doesn't automatically launch following QR provisioning, but DPC extras are successfully passed through. There is no NFC radio, and so no NFC provisioning.

### Motorola Moto E4 Plus

Tested 2017

Fully managed (COBO)  
Managed work profile (COPE)

NFC provisioning  
AFW# provisioning  
QR provisioning  
Zero-touch enrolment

Notes: Following completion of provisioning, the user is presented with a number of agreements to accept, only the top two are mandatory and others can be skipped. For those searching for zero-touch compatibility, Samsung will not support it for the foreseeable future. As of Android 8.0, Samsung switches from the unified work profile to Workspace. The UX is similar but different. Additionally, when provisioning managed work profile in MobileIron (COPE), the settings app crashes whilst setting a passcode and can not be recovered.
