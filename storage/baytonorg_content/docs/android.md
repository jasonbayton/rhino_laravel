If you manage Android devices in the enterprise, you've come to the right place! Below you'll find a selection of documents covering all aspects of Android and Android Enterprise.

Whether you're just discovering Android Enterprise or are looking to boost existing knowledge, the below should be helpful across the board. Looking for something specific that hasn't been documented? Submit your question [in my new form](https://forms.gle/2VVDeYHiTFhPT2oVA)!

### Device administrator deprecation

Device admin deprecation is now official with Android 10! Unsure what this means? Take a look at this [infographic](/docs/enterprise-mobility/android/infobyte-did-you-know-device-admin-deprecation/), this [article](/2017/12/google-is-deprecating-device-admin-in-favour-of-android-enterprise/) and this [article](/2019/03/android-enterprise-in-q-features-and-clarity-on-da-deprecation/#clarity-on-da-deprecation-in-q). All EMMs must now be targeting API 29, which means all deprecated DA APIs for Android 10 devices are enforced.
