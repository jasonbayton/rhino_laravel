With only minutes to go I'd like to wish my readers a happy new year and a very successful 2016.

2015 has been a good year for bayton.org, with over 11,000 views from over 8,000 visitors ranging from Macedonia to Mauritius, Europe and the USA.

Still today, despite writing it in 2011, my article on [The Virtualbox bug: “Cannot access the kernel driver” in Windows](/2011/03/the-virtualbox-bug-cannot-access-the-kernel-driver-in-windows/Windows) ranks highest for views with almost 3,000 on its own this year, followed by my [First look: Miradore Online free MDM](/2014/07/miradore-online-free-mdm/) at 1,800 and [A month with Wandera Mobile Gateway](/2014/05/a-month-with-wandera-mobile-gateway/) at 1,100.

Of all my visitors this year, the majority of referees came from Reddit, followed by Spiceworks, Facebook and Twitter. All of these paled in comparison to those from search however, which still dominates the analytics at almost 7,000 hits alone.

I want to thank you all for visiting! Without you there'd be little point in spending my free time working on articles. Knowing I'm reaching an audience year on year makes it all worthwhile.

All the best for the year to come, and I hope to welcome you back in future.
