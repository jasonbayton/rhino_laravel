#### Article extract

The following is a modified extract from [LXD, ZFS and bridged networking on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS](/2016/05/lxd-zfs-and-bridged-networking-on-ubuntu-16-04-lts/). As bridged networking is quite a popular topic I felt it's worth its own post to reduce the need to go looking for it in the longer guides I've written. I'll also link to it from new guides going forward.

**NB:** Ubuntu 12.04 LTS is the earliest release I've used this with. It should work on earlier versions as well, but your mileage may vary.

## Installation

In order to set up a network bridge, the package `bridge-utils` needs to be installed. Install it with:

`sudo apt-get install bridge-utils`

The output should look similar to below:

Reading package lists... Done

The following NEW packages will be installed:

#### This is mandatory

If `bridge-utils` isn't installed before moving on, it won't be possible to bring up the new bridge and will likely result in loss of network access entirely.

## Configuration

With the `bridge-utils` package installed, begin by opening `/etc/network/interfaces` in a text editor. I like vim:

`sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces`

\# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

This is the default `interfaces` file. Within this file add a new bridge named `br0`. The simplest edit to make is as follows (note the emphasis):

\# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
auto **br0**
iface **br0** inet dhcp
    **bridge\_ports eth0**

iface eth0 inet **manual**

This will set the `eth0` interface to _manual_ and create a new bridge that piggybacks directly off it. If you wish to create a static interface while you’re editing this file, the following may help you:

\# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
auto br0 
iface br0 inet static
        address 192.168.0.44
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        network 192.168.0.0
        broadcast 192.168.0.255
        gateway 192.168.0.1
        # dns-\* options are implemented by the resolvconf package, if installed
        dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 #google-dns
        dns-search localdomain.local #optional-line
        # bridge options
        bridge\_ports eth0
iface eth0 inet manual

Following any edits, it’s a good idea to restart the interfaces to force the changes to take place. Obviously if you’re connected via SSH this will disconnect your session. You’ll need to have physical access to the machine/VM.

`sudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0 && sudo ifup br0`

Running `ifconfig` on the CLI will now confirm the changes have been applied:

jason@ubuntu-lxdzfs:~$ ifconfig

\[...\]

If for any reason no changes have applied, or `ifconfig` returns no IPv4 addresses at all, please double check the configuration and optionally give the host a reboot.

Congratulations, you now have a bridged network with which to provide direct LAN access to your virtualised guests!
