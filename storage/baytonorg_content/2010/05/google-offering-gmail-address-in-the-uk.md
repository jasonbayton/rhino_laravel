Google are offering us UK folk the option of now switching from @[googlemail.com](http://googlemail.com) to @[gmail.com](http://gmail.com) after finally winning a battle that has been going on since around 2005.

Here is the link to directly change (you need to be logged in!) [https://mail.google.com/mail/googlemail/rebrand \[dead\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/googlemail/rebrand)

Here's a little known fact: Even though we have had @[googlemail.com](http://googlemail.com) addresses until now, "secretly" we've also had @[gmail.com](http://gmail.com) addresses, which were simply not shown. If you have the account [firstname.lastname@googlemail.com](mailto:firstname.lastname@googlemail.com) and someone sent the mail to [firstname.lastname@gmail.com](mailto:firstname.lastname@gmail.com) you would still get it.

Didn't know that? Why don't you try sending a mail to yourself with the alternate address? That includes you @[gmail.com](http://gmail.com) users! Prefer @[googlemail.com](http://googlemail.com)? Then use it! Simply set up a _send mail as_ in settings > accounts, follow the on-screen instructions and you can choose which email address you want to send from. It really is that easy.

Enjoy!
