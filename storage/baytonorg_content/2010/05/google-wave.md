Can you see this wave? If not don't fret! [Here's my post \[deleted\]](/post/gwave-revolution/) in a normal, easy to read format just as you've come to expect from me. If you would like a Wave account, why not [get in touch](/contact)? I have plenty of invitations, and I like to share.

<script src="http://www.google.com/jsapi" type="text/javascript"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[ google.load("wave", "1"); google.setOnLoadCallback(initialize); function initialize() { var waveframe = document.getElementById("waveframe"); var embedOptions = { target: waveframe, header: false, toolbar: true, footer: true }; var wavePanel = new google.wave.WavePanel(embedOptions); wavePanel.loadWave("googlewave.com!w+xUw-TV_WD"); } // ]]></script>

 Internet Explorer users, unfortunately Google are still working on getting this to show for you guys, if you're not happy waiting then I _urge_ you to view my [guide for switching to a much newer, better browser](/2010/04/alternatives-to-internet-explorer/). It's for your own good - once you change, you will never look back.

Cheers, Jason
