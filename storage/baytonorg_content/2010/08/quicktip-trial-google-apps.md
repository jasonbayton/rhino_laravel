Are you interested in Google Apps Premier edition? If, like me, you wish to "try" Premier Edition without affecting your current apps domain (or if you haven't yet got a domain..) Google have a quick and dirty solution! Keep your email address to hand, and you'll have a 14 day (slightly limited) Premier trial in 10 minutes flat!

Here's the procedure:

Log onto the following page: [http://www.google.com/a/cpanel/sample/new](http://www.google.com/a/cpanel/sample/new)
