2013 was one of the best years in the history of bayton.org. Although there has been a continued interest in a number of my older posts such as [this one from 2011](/2011/03/the-virtualbox-bug-cannot-access-the-kernel-driver-in-windows/ "The Virtualbox bug: “Cannot access the kernel driver” in Windows") through search engines, I can attribute an increased number of views and interactions of a number of posts - old and new - to social sharing.

[Google+](//plus.google.com), [Facebook](//facebook.com) and [Linkedin](//linkedin.com) are in my list of top referrers\* all throughout 2013. In fact, aside from Google search, Google+ and Facebook ranked 2nd and 3rd in referral traffic respectfully, sitting above search engines such as Bing, Duck Duck Go, Yahoo and so on. That's impressive!

I use a combination of [Wordpress Jetpack](//jetpack.me) and [Google analytics](//google.com/analytics) to keep an eye on site statistics and each year Wordpress, through Jetpack, send me a "year in review" that shows top posts, views, comments and more that I've uploaded below.

Are you interested in social sharing? If you're a Wordpress user, Jetpack's [Publicize](http://jetpack.me/support/publicize/) feature works flawlessly - even with Google+ profiles (not just pages as some services provide). Otherwise, you might find [Dlvr.](//dlvr.it)[it](//dlvr.it) or [ifttt](//ifttt.com) (If this then that) useful. Both of which use RSS feeds to publish posts to social networks. I've written previously about dlvr.it [here](/2011/08/push-your-google-posts-to-twitter-and-facebook/ "Push your Google+ posts to Twitter and Facebook"), [here](/2011/05/managing-your-social-outreach-with-dlvr-it/ "Managing your social outreach with dlvr.it"), [here](/2011/05/pushing-buzz-to-twitter-with-dlvr-it/ "Pushing Buzz to Twitter with dlvr.it") and [here](/2012/03/why-i-disabled-dlvr-it-links-on-facebook/ "Why I disabled dlvr.it links on Facebook").

\* Interestingly, Twitter is very low in that list. Perhaps that'll change in 2014!
