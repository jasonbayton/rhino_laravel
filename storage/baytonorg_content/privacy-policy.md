## In summary

**The website offers cookies and site storage** for remembering whether you want a dark or light theme, remembering any details you willingly submit and just generally acting like a website you've visited before rather than visiting in incognito every time.

**I do not sell ad space**, nor do I intend to. Your data is therefore not being mined to line my pockets.

**I do collect analytics data**, mostly to keep tabs on how the site is performing - post views, countries that visit, browser and OS details, and so on. Where offered however **I anonymise identifiable info** such as full IP ranges. Current analytics platforms are Google, JetPack and my own self-hosted Matomo.

If you want your info deleted, just ask.

This is to help spam detection and in order for the content to be adequately displayed on the website in a way it can be engaged with and notifications of replies can be sent.
