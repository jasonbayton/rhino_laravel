**The competition is closed! Congratulations to David in Scotland on the win!**

To celebrate the growing success of [documentation](/docs) - accounting for just under 50% of all website traffic already in only 6 months of being live - I'm doing a giveaway on the latest device to be tested against [Android enterprise compatibility](/docs/enterprise-mobility/android/android-enterprise-device-support/) (results will be going live next week):

The [Motorola Moto C Plus](https://www.motorola.com/we/products/moto-c-plus) in Starry Black.

The device is brand new (arrived yesterday), barely used and therefore in perfect condition. I have all the devices I need here, so putting the Moto on a shelf would be a waste.
