I'm attending MobileIron LIVE 2018 on the 16th and 17th of May.

Follow along below, or feel free to head over to the [Discuss topic](https://discuss.bayton.org/t/live-mobileiron-live-2018/135) for live updates.

I'll be arriving a little late so will miss the opening, but I'll look to circle back around to that when I get there.

Something to say? Questions for the MobileIron team? Leave a comment below and I'll aim to answer!
